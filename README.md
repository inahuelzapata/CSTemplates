# CSTemplates

This is my adapted version for the CleanSwift templates of @Rayvinly, which its homepage is https://clean-swift.com/.

You may notice, if you have the basic templates, that my version is aligned with SwiftLint rules.

I also added a new component called *Navigator* that conforms to *Navigatable* protocol. This component was designed in order to reuse the navigation flow in all the Scenes.

Hope you enjoy it!
