# CSTemplates

This is my adapted version for the CleanSwift templates of @Rayvinly.

As you may notice, if you have the basic templates, my version is aligned with SwiftLint rules.

I also added a new component called *Navigator* that conforms to *Navigatable* protocol. This component was designed in order to reuse the navigation flow in all the Scenes.
